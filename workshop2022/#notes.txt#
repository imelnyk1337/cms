MuHistos_eospublic.cxx++
takes 40 minutes on naf-cms24
takes  5 minutes on lxplus

MuHistos_local.cxx++
takes 5 minutes on naf-cms24 after sourcing, 5-10 minutes before sourcing,
no obvious time difference upon repeated execution.

Downloading from eospublic to DESY dust with xdrcp:
takes 40 min/50 GB 

Dimuon2011_eospublic.C
takes hours when executed from naf-cms24

Dimuon2011_local.C 
takes 25 min when executed for the first time, 10 min when executed 
the second time on naf-cms24

Some interference with other activity. Need to try some of the timings again 
when naf will be "empty".
